# üìä Player Re-Identification & Tracking Report

This report documents the performance of different configurations for the player re-identification and multi-object tracking pipeline. Each approach progressively adjusts detection thresholds and DeepSORT parameters to balance coverage, stability, and smoothness.

---

## üèÅ Approach 1: Baseline DeepSORT

### üîß Parameters
- **Detection confidence threshold:** 0.5 (default)
- **DeepSORT parameters:**
  - `max_age = 30`
  - `n_init = 3`
  - `max_iou_distance = 0.7`

---

### üìà Tracking Statistics
| Metric                            | Value      |
|------------------------------------|------------|
| Total tracks                      | 5          |
| Average track length              | 82.20 frames |
| Median track length               | 39.00 frames |
| Tracks longer than 10 frames      | 5          |
| Average tracks per frame          | 1.19       |
| Average centroid step per track   | 7.76 pixels |

---

### üí° Insights
1. **Low Number of Tracks**  
   - Only 5 tracks created, suggesting missed detections or overly strict parameters.  
2. **Long Track Lengths**  
   - Average length is high; the tracker maintains identity well for detected objects.  
3. **Sparse Coverage**  
   - Only ~1 object tracked per frame. More players should be detected in a sports scenario.  
4. **Smoothness**  
   - Low centroid step indicates smooth tracking with minimal ID switches.  

---

### ‚úÖ Recommendations
- Increase detection sensitivity to cover more objects.  
- Loosen association thresholds to prevent missed matches.  
- Visualize missed frames to debug detection gaps.  

---

## üèÅ Approach 2: Lowered Detection Threshold & Tuned DeepSORT

### üîß Changes
- **Detection confidence threshold:** 0.3
- **DeepSORT parameters:**
  - `max_age = 50` (longer track lifetime without detections)
  - `n_init = 2` (fewer detections needed to confirm a track)
  - `max_iou_distance = 0.9` (more flexible association)

---

### üìà Tracking Statistics
| Metric                            | Value      |
|------------------------------------|------------|
| Total tracks                      | 6          |
| Average track length              | 92.50 frames |
| Median track length               | 55.50 frames |
| Tracks longer than 10 frames      | 6          |
| Average tracks per frame          | 1.49       |
| Average centroid step per track   | 9.04 pixels |

---

### üí° Insights
1. **Improved Coverage**  
   - Slightly more tracks created (6 vs. 5), with all tracks longer than 10 frames.  
2. **Better Average Tracks per Frame**  
   - Increased to 1.49, meaning more simultaneous objects tracked.  
3. **Smoothness**  
   - Centroid step still reasonable at 9.04 px.  
4. **Remaining Gaps**  
   - Coverage remains below ideal levels for multi-person scenarios.  

---

### ‚úÖ Recommendations
- Lower detection threshold further to capture more objects.  
- Continue tuning association parameters for improved coverage.  

---

## üèÅ Approach 3: Further Lowered Threshold & Flexible DeepSORT (Best)

### üîß Changes
- **Detection confidence threshold:** 0.15
- **DeepSORT parameters:**
  - `max_age = 80`
  - `n_init = 2`
  - `max_iou_distance = 0.95`

---

### üìà Tracking Statistics

| Average track length              | 122.86 frames |
| Median track length               | 82.00 frames |
| Tracks longer than 10 frames      | 7          |
| Average tracks per frame          | 2.31       |
| Average centroid step per track   | 8.22 pixels |

---

### üí° Insights
1. **Best Coverage So Far**  
   - Average 2.31 tracks per frame, tracking more objects simultaneously.  
2. **Long, Stable Tracks**  
   - All tracks are persistent with high average and median lengths.  
3. **Smooth Tracking**  
   - Centroid step of 8.22 px indicates consistent tracking with minimal jumps.  
4. **Overall Performance**  
   - This approach strikes the best balance between coverage and stability.  

---

## üèÅ Approach 4: Appearance-based Association + Occlusion Handling

### üîß Steps Implemented
1. **Detection:** Objects detected per frame (threshold = 0.2).  
2. **Appearance Features:** Extracted deep feature vectors for ReID.  
3. **Data Association:** Combined IOU and cosine similarity for matching.  
4. **Track Management:** Created new tracks for unmatched detections.  
5. **Occlusion Handling:** Interpolated centroids for short occlusion gaps.  
6. **Post-processing:** Removed short noisy tracks.

### üìà Tracking Statistics
| Metric                            | Value      |
|------------------------------------|------------|
| Total tracks                      | 14         |
| Average track length              | 19.00 frames |
| Median track length               | 1.00 frames |
| Tracks longer than 10 frames      | 4          |
| Average tracks per frame          | 1.06       |
| Average centroid step per track   | 30.35 pixels |

---

### üí° Insights
1. **High Fragmentation**  
   - Many short-lived tracks (median = 1 frame). Only 4 tracks >10 frames.  
2. **Poor Stability**  
   - Large centroid step (30.35 px) indicates erratic tracking and ID switches.  
3. **Low Coverage**  
   - Average tracks per frame drops back to 1.06.  

---

### ‚úÖ Recommendations
- Fine-tune ReID model for dataset-specific features.  
- Improve association robustness to reduce fragmentation.  
- Refine occlusion handling and interpolation algorithms.
