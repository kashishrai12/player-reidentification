Comparison of Approaches
Approach 1: Baseline DeepSORT
Stats:
Total tracks: 5
Avg. track length: 82.20
Median: 39.00
Tracks >10 frames: 5
Avg. tracks/frame: 1.19
Avg. centroid step: 7.76 px
Insights:
Very few tracks, but those that exist are long and stable.
Coverage is low; most objects are not tracked.
Smooth tracking for detected objects.



Approach 2: Lowered Detection Threshold & Tuned DeepSORT
Stats:
Total tracks: 6
Avg. track length: 92.50
Median: 55.50
Tracks >10 frames: 6
Avg. tracks/frame: 1.49
Avg. centroid step: 9.04 px
Insights:
Slightly more tracks and better coverage than Approach 1.
Tracks remain long and stable.
Still, coverage is not ideal for multi-object scenarios.



Approach 3: Further Lowered Threshold & More Flexible DeepSORT
Stats:
Total tracks: 7
Avg. track length: 122.86
Median: 82.00
Tracks >10 frames: 7
Avg. tracks/frame: 2.31
Avg. centroid step: 8.22 px
Insights:
Best coverage so far: more objects tracked per frame.
All tracks are long and stable.
Smooth tracking is maintained.
This approach achieves the best balance between coverage and track stability.


Approach 4: Appearance-based Association, Occlusion Handling, Post-processing
Stats:
Total tracks: 14
Avg. track length: 19.00
Median: 1.00
Tracks >10 frames: 4
Avg. tracks/frame: 1.06
Avg. centroid step: 30.35 px
Insights:
Many tracks, but most are extremely short (median = 1 frame).
High fragmentation and instability (large centroid jumps).
Coverage is low and tracking is not robust.



Best Approach
Approach 3 is the best among the four.

It achieves the highest average tracks per frame (2.31), meaning more objects are tracked at the same time.
All tracks are long (avg. 122.86 frames, median 82), indicating stable and persistent tracking.
The average centroid step is low, showing smooth and consistent tracking.
It balances coverage and stability better than the other approaches.


Improvements for Future Work
If time and resources were not a constraint, the following improvements could further enhance tracking performance:

1. Use a Stronger Detector:

Employ a more advanced object detector (e.g., YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN) for better detection coverage and accuracy.

2. Fine-tune the ReID Model:

Fine-tune the appearance feature extractor on your specific dataset for improved discrimination between similar objects.

3. Advanced Data Association:

Implement more sophisticated association strategies (e.g., combining motion, appearance, and temporal consistency with learned weights).

4. Better Occlusion Handling:

Use tracklet linking, re-identification after long occlusions, and more robust interpolation.

5. Feature Engineering:

Incorporate additional features such as color histograms, pose estimation, or temporal context.

6. Track Merging and Cleaning:

Develop algorithms to merge fragmented tracks and remove false positives more effectively.

7. Hyperparameter Optimization:

Systematically tune all parameters (detection threshold, tracker settings, association weights) using grid search or Bayesian optimization.

8. Quantitative Evaluation:

Use ground truth data and compute standard metrics (MOTA, MOTP, IDF1, etc.) for objective assessment.



Summary Table
Approach	    Coverage	Track Stability	Fragmentation	Smoothness	    Best Use Case
1 (Baseline)	Low	        High	        Low	            High	        Stable, few objects
2 (Tuned)	    Medium	    High	        Low	            High	        Slightly more coverage
3 (Best)	    High	    High	        Low	            High	        Best overall balance
4 (ReID+Interp)	Low	        Low	            High	        Low	            Needs tuning


Conclusion
Approach 3 is recommended as the best current solution, offering the best trade-off between coverage and stability.
Future improvements should focus on detection quality, appearance model fine-tuning, advanced association, and robust post-processing to further enhance multi-object tracking performance.
